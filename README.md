## Game Rules

### Objective
Teams take turns giving one-word clues to help their teammates guess the target word. The team with the most correct guesses wins!

### How to Play
1. **Setup**: Players are divided into two teams
2. **Rounds**: Each round, teams alternate giving clues
3. **Clue Giving**: One player gives a one-word clue for the target word
4. **Guessing**: The team has limited time to guess the word
5. **Scoring**: Correct guesses earn points for the team
6. **Winning**: The team with the most points after all rounds wins

### Multiplayer Features
- **Room Codes**: Private rooms generate 6-character codes (e.g., "ABC123")
- **Ready System**: All players must mark themselves as ready before starting
- **Leader Controls**: Room creators can start the game
- **Real-time Updates**: All game actions are synchronized across players
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Inactive rooms and players are automatically removed

## Technical Architecture

- `multiplayerClient.js`: Client-side multiplayer functionality
- `multiplayerUI.js`: Multiplayer user interface components
- `script.js`: Main game logic (enhanced with multiplayer support)

## API Endpoints

### REST API
- `GET /health`: Server health check
- `GET /api/stats`: Server statistics

### WebSocket Events
- `player_join`: Join as a player
- `find_public_game`: Find or create public room

- `join_private_room`: Join room with code
- `player_ready`: Set ready status
- `start_game`: Start the game
- `game_action`: Send game actions (clues, guesses, etc.)

## Configuration

    roomCodeLength: 6,
    maxRooms: 1000,
    playerTimeout: 300000, // 5 minutes
    gameTimeout: 1800000   // 30 minutes
};

```

## Security Features
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers
